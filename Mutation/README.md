DNA Mutations:
1. Point mutation/Substitution – one base replaced with another base
2. Inversion – order of two or more bases is reversed
3. Insertion – addition of one or more new bases
4. Deletion – removal of one or more bases
5. Translocation – movement of one or more bases to a new location in a different DNA sequence


Effect of Mutations of Protein Level:
1. Silent mutation – mutation that causes no change in amino acid sequence
2. Missense mutation – mutation that changes the identity of an amino acid added
3. Nonsense mutations – mutation that shortens a protein by replacing an amino acid codon with a stop codon
4. Frameshift mutation – mutation that alters the reading frame in which codons are translated
